For each year following your hip replacement, you have a 0.5 to 1% chance of requiring additional surgery. For example, at 10 years post operatively, there is a 90-95% success rate.\n\nWhen should I follow up with my surgeon?\n\nFollow-up appointments beyond the initial postoperative period should be made at 1 year, 5 years, and every 5 years after that.\n\nNormal things about your new hip:\n\n- Clicking noise with hip motion\n- Skin numbness near or around your incision\n- Swelling around hip, knee, and\/or lower leg\n- Warmth around hip\n- \u201cPins and needles\u201d feeling at or near incision\n- Dark or red incision line\n- Increased bruising while on blood thinner\n\nAbnormal things (call the office immediately):\n\n- Increasing redness from the incision\n- Increasing pain and swelling\n- Fevers more than 101.5 F\n- Persistent drainage lasting beyond 3 days\n- Calf pain or swelling\n- Inability to put weight on your leg\n- Bleeding gums or blood in urine or stool\n","Celecoxib (Celebrex) 200 mg should be taken daily for the first 14 days after surgery.\n\nSenokot is the preferred stool softener and is to be taken routinely while on narcotic pain medications because of constipation. Also, drink plenty of water and diet rich in fiber to help with constipation.\n\nHelps prevent stomach irritation from medications. Your surgeon may or may not prescribe it. These can also be purchased over the counter; examples include omeprazole or Prilosec.\n\nCommon Post-Operative Concerns:\n\nPain\n\nPain is expected after total joint replacement. Intensity and duration vary for different procedures and from patient to patient. Use medications as prescribed to prevent uncontrolled pain. Initial 2-week medication supply will be provided and can be continued per discretion of the surgeon. Refills cannot be called into the pharmacy and will require an office visit. Uncontrolled pain may require modifications to pain management strategy.\n\nSwelling\n\nSwelling is also expected after total joint replacement and may be associated with bruising and discoloration. Blistering is less common and you should notify the office if this occurs. Swelling typically improves after post-operative day 10.\n\nIce and elevation help control swelling. Patients should apply ice for 15-20 minutes every 1-2 hours (not directly on the skin, use a towel between). If swelling is not improved with conservative treatments, compression stockings may be required. Call the office if swelling does not improve or worsens despite these measures.\n\nConstipation\n\nConstipation occurs from use of narcotics. Patients should take prescribed stool softener (Senokot), drink plenty of water, and consume a high fiber diet.\n\nNausea\n\nNausea is a common side effect of pain medications. If you are unable to tolerate the prescribed pain medication, call our office to change the type of pain medication and find one that is right for you.\n\nBlood Clots\/ DVT\n\nTotal joint replacement carries a risk of developing a blood clot in your legs and that is why you must take a blood thinner. However, they can still occur while taking blood thinners. Common signs include excessive leg or calf swelling and uncontrolled pain. Call the office if you are concerned regarding a blood clot.\n\nIf a blood clot travels to your lungs, it is called a pulmonary embolus which can cause a serious complication. Signs and symptoms include chest pain and\/or shortness of breath. If you develop these symptoms, please go to Emergency Room or call 911.\n"],"1":["How long will my hip replacement last?\n\nThis varies from patient to patient.

Do I need a doctor\u2019s note to travel?\n\nYou will likely set off the airport security machine. You do not require a doctor\u2019s note to show you have an artificial hip. Simply inform the security agent and you will likely require a separate screening.\n\nWhat activities are permitted after surgery?\n\nAfter 6 weeks, you are permitted to perform low stress activities such as walking, gardening, swimming and cycling. After 12 weeks, you are permitted to begin playing golf, racquet sports and gentle skiing.\n\nWhat activities should I avoid?\n\nYou should avoid impact activities such as running, aggressive skiing; heavy weight lifting, and other aggressive activities for the first 12 weeks. You should also avoid activities that involve heavy twisting movements like golf or bowling for the first 12 weeks. Then return, as you feel comfortable.\n\nCan I have sex?\n\nYou should wait several weeks after surgery before resuming sexual intercourse until you feel comfortable. Avoid extremes of motion. Having your legs apart is a safe position.\n\nCan I drink alcohol?\n\nWhile on blood thinners, you should avoid alcohol. You should also avoid alcohol while taking narcotics.\n\nShould I use ice or heat?\n\nIce should be used for the first several days to help with pain and swelling. We do not recommend using heat.\n\nCan I use stairs?\n\nYes. Initially you will lead with your non-operated leg when going up stairs and lead with you operated leg when going down stairs. Remember \u201cUp with the good, down with the bad.\u201d After about 4 weeks, you should begin using the stairs more normally.\n\nCan I kneel?\n\nYes. To kneel, touch down with the knee of your operated leg first. To arise from kneeling, use your non-operative leg first.\n\nI feel depressed \u2013 is this normal?\n\nIt is not uncommon to have feelings of depression after your hip replacement. This may be due to a variety of factors such as limited mobility, discomfort, increased dependency on others, and\/or medication side effects. Feelings of depression will typically fade as you begin to return to your regular activities. If your feelings of depression persist, consult your internist.\n\nI have insomnia \u2013 is this normal?\n\nDifficulty sleeping is a very common complaint following hip surgery. Non-prescription remedies such as Benadryl or melatonin may be effective. If this continues to be a problem, medication may be prescribed for you.\n\nWhat can I do about my scar?\n\nMost hip scars eventually become minor. If you feel hardness this may be to a suture dissolving underneath. After 3 weeks, and the wound is not draining, you can take some Vitamin E cream and begin some gentle massage to the wound. Avoid direct sun to the wound for 6 months to prevent darkening of the scar.\n"],"2":[null,null,null],"3":["How long will my hip replacement last?\n\nThis varies from patient to patient.

In most cases, however, you will be restricted to using a walker or crutches for between 1 to 4 weeks. You will then be allowed to advance to a cane outdoors and no support around the house for several weeks. You will gradually return to normal function without any assistive devices. You will use an assistive device until you can walk without a limp. This usually takes about 3 months.\n\nWhat is a dislocation of the hip?\n\nA dislocation of the hip occurs when the femoral head (ball) comes out of the acetabulum (socket). While this risk is very small, typically less than 1%, we will ask you to avoid extremes of motion at the hip.\n\nWhat are the dislocation precautions for my hip (positions I should avoid)?\n\nThe goal of a hip replacement is to return your motion to the normal motion you had when your hip was healthy. In general, you should avoid positions that you have never been able to do. If you have to reach the floor, or fix your shoes, always reach between your legs, not to the outside. You should try to follow these rules for about 8 weeks. When you move your hip and feel resistance, stop, that is as far as you should go.\n\nCan I sleep on my side?\n\nYes\n\nHow long will I be on pain medication?\n\nOnce the initial postoperative pain has subsided, we recommend Acetaminophen (Tylenol) to be taken instead of the narcotic you have been provided. It is also okay to take an anti-inflammatory medication (NSAID) such as Advil ONLY after finishing the blood thinners. Remember, you cannot drive while taking narcotic medications.\n\nWill I go to a rehabilitation facility or home?\n\nWe prefer our patients to go directly home after surgery. There may be special situations, which require a rehabilitation facility, depending on your social support structure.\n\nDo I need physical therapy?","Frequently Asked Questions after Total Hip Replacement Surgery\n\nWhat is the recovery time?\n\nEveryone heals from their surgery at a different pace.

There may be special situations, which require a rehabilitation facility, depending on your social support structure.\n\nDo I need physical therapy?\n\nYes! The physical therapist plays a very important role in your recovery. You will see a physical therapist soon after your operation and throughout your stay in the hospital. If you go home, you will likely have the therapist come to visit you (either as an evaluation or for more). Sometimes you will be referred to an outpatient physical therapist. If you go to a rehabilitation facility, you will receive therapy there. Your therapist will help you walk, regain motion, build strength, and help you reach your post-operative goals. Your therapist will keep your surgeon informed of your progress.\n\nWhat exercises should I do?\n\nYou will be instructed by your physical therapist on appropriate exercises and given a list to follow. In general, swimming (after 3 weeks) and a stationary bicycle are good exercise options. These exercises should be continued indefinitely even after your recovery is complete. You can begin using a stationary bike immediately; just make sure you keep the seat high.\n"],"5":["I feel depressed \u2013 is this normal?\n\nIt is not uncommon to have feelings of depression after your hip replacement.

Following a well-structured conditioning program will also help you return to sports and other recreational activities.\n\nThis is a general conditioning program that provides a wide range of exercises. To ensure that the program is safe and effective for you, it should be performed under your doctor's supervision. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist about which exercises will best help you meet your rehabilitation goals.\n\nStrength: Strengthening the muscles that support your knee will reduce stress on your knee joint. Strong muscles help your knee joint absorb shock.\n\nFlexibility: Stretching the muscles that you strengthen is important for restoring range of motion and preventing injury. Gently stretching after strengthening exercises can help reduce muscle soreness and keep your muscles long and flexible.\n\nTarget Muscles: The muscle groups targeted in this conditioning program include:\n\n\u00b7 Quadriceps (front of the thigh)\n\n\u00b7 Hamstrings (back of the thigh)\n\n\u00b7 Abductors (outer thigh)\n\n\u00b7 Adductors (inner thigh)\n\n\u00b7 Gluteus medius and gluteus maximus (buttocks)\n\nLength of program: This knee conditioning program should be continued for 4 to 6 weeks, unless otherwise specified by your doctor or physical therapist. After your recovery, these exercises can be continued as a maintenance program for lifelong protection and health of your knees. Performing the exercises two to three days a week will maintain strength and range of motion in your knees.\n\nGetting Started\n\nWarmup: Before doing the following exercises, warm up with 5 to 10 minutes of low impact activity, like walking or riding a stationary bicycle.\n\nStretch: After the warm-up, do the stretching exercises shown on Page 1 before moving on to the strengthening exercises. When you have completed the strengthening exercises, repeat the stretching exercises to end the program.\n\nDo not ignore pain: You should not feel pain during an exercise. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist if you have any pain while exercising.\n\nAsk questions: If you are not sure how to do an exercise, or how often to do it, contact your doctor or physical therapist.\n\nAAOS does not endorse any treatments, procedures, products, or physicians referenced herein.

Also, arrange transportation for post-op appointments (2 weeks and 6 weeks after surgery). DO NOT drive until cleared by surgeon, which is usually 2-4 weeks after surgery.\n\nTotal Joint Replacement Post-Op Care\n\nDischarge Disposition:\n\nHome is the primary discharge location after total joint replacement surgery. Patients are encouraged to go home with help from friends or family members.\n\nAlternative discharge locations such as skilled nursing facilities or rehabilitation facilities depend on multiple factors including social support, medical conditions, home set-up, insurance coverage, and safety.\n\nPhysical Therapy:\n\nPhysical therapy will be arranged while in the hospital by the case manager.\n\nTotal knee patients are encouraged to begin outpatient physical therapy after discharge.

These can also be purchased over the counter; examples include omeprazole or Prilosec.\n\nCommon Post-Operative Concerns:\n\nPain\n\nPain is expected after total joint replacement. Intensity and duration vary for different procedures and from patient to patient. Use medications as prescribed to prevent uncontrolled pain. Initial 2-week medication supply will be provided and can be continued per discretion of the surgeon. Refills cannot be called into the pharmacy and will require an office visit. Uncontrolled pain may require modifications to pain management strategy.\n\nSwelling\n\nSwelling is also expected after total joint replacement and may be associated with bruising and discoloration. Blistering is less common and you should notify the office if this occurs. Swelling typically improves after post-operative day 10.\n\nIce and elevation help control swelling. Patients should apply ice for 15-20 minutes every 1-2 hours (not directly on the skin, use a towel between). If swelling is not improved with conservative treatments, compression stockings may be required. Call the office if swelling does not improve or worsens despite these measures.\n\nConstipation\n\nConstipation occurs from use of narcotics. Patients should take prescribed stool softener (Senokot), drink plenty of water, and consume a high fiber diet.\n\nNausea\n\nNausea is a common side effect of pain medications. If you are unable to tolerate the prescribed pain medication, call our office to change the type of pain medication and find one that is right for you.\n\nBlood Clots\/ DVT\n\nTotal joint replacement carries a risk of developing a blood clot in your legs and that is why you must take a blood thinner. However, they can still occur while taking blood thinners. Common signs include excessive leg or calf swelling and uncontrolled pain. Call the office if you are concerned regarding a blood clot.\n\nIf a blood clot travels to your lungs, it is called a pulmonary embolus which can cause a serious complication. Signs and symptoms include chest pain and\/or shortness of breath.

Handrails in the stairs will make navigating stairs easier.\n\nSitting \u2013 A firm straight back chair with arm rests and a high seat will be best. A chair where knees are higher than your hips, is too low. You can add a foam cushion or pillow to elevate you if needed.\n\nSleeping \u2013 Ideally sleeping arrangements should be made so that you may sleep on the first floor of your home.\n\nFood \u2013 Arrange for assistance with meals. Freeze premade dinners ahead of time or have protein shakes available for quick access when needed. Good nutrition is needed to help you heal.\n\nTransportation \u2013 Prior to surgery, have transportation arranged for anticipated discharge date. Also, arrange transportation for post-op appointments (2 weeks and 6 weeks after surgery). DO NOT drive until cleared by surgeon, which is usually 2-4 weeks after surgery.\n\nTotal Joint Replacement Post-Op Care\n\nDischarge Disposition:\n\nHome is the primary discharge location after total joint replacement surgery. Patients are encouraged to go home with help from friends or family members.\n\nAlternative discharge locations such as skilled nursing facilities or rehabilitation facilities depend on multiple factors including social support, medical conditions, home set-up, insurance coverage, and safety.\n\nPhysical Therapy:\n\nPhysical therapy will be arranged while in the hospital by the case manager.\n\nTotal knee patients are encouraged to begin outpatient physical therapy after discharge. Outpatient facilities have more equipment to work with and facilitate faster recovery and knee range of motion.\n"],"19":["Celecoxib (Celebrex) 200 mg should be taken daily for the first 14 days after surgery.\n\nSenokot is the preferred stool softener and is to be taken routinely while on narcotic pain medications because of constipation.

These can also be purchased over the counter; examples include omeprazole or Prilosec.\n\nCommon Post-Operative Concerns:\n\nPain\n\nPain is expected after total joint replacement. Intensity and duration vary for different procedures and from patient to patient. Use medications as prescribed to prevent uncontrolled pain. Initial 2-week medication supply will be provided and can be continued per discretion of the surgeon. Refills cannot be called into the pharmacy and will require an office visit.

Blistering is less common and you should notify the office if this occurs. Swelling typically improves after post-operative day 10.\n\nIce and elevation help control swelling. Patients should apply ice for 15-20 minutes every 1-2 hours (not directly on the skin, use a towel between). If swelling is not improved with conservative treatments, compression stockings may be required. Call the office if swelling does not improve or worsens despite these measures.\n\nConstipation\n\nConstipation occurs from use of narcotics.

If you are unable to tolerate the prescribed pain medication, call our office to change the type of pain medication and find one that is right for you.\n\nBlood Clots\/ DVT\n\nTotal joint replacement carries a risk of developing a blood clot in your legs and that is why you must take a blood thinner. However, they can still occur while taking blood thinners. Common signs include excessive leg or calf swelling and uncontrolled pain. Call the office if you are concerned regarding a blood clot.\n\nIf a blood clot travels to your lungs, it is called a pulmonary embolus which can cause a serious complication.

In most cases, however, you will be restricted to using a walker or crutches for between 1 to 4 weeks. You will then be allowed to advance to a cane outdoors and no support around the house for several weeks. You will gradually return to normal function without any assistive devices. You will use an assistive device until you can walk without a limp. This usually takes about 3 months.\n\nWhat is a dislocation of the hip?\n\nA dislocation of the hip occurs when the femoral head (ball) comes out of the acetabulum (socket). While this risk is very small, typically less than 1%, we will ask you to avoid extremes of motion at the hip.\n\nWhat are the dislocation precautions for my hip (positions I should avoid)?\n\nThe goal of a hip replacement is to return your motion to the normal motion you had when your hip was healthy. In general, you should avoid positions that you have never been able to do. If you have to reach the floor, or fix your shoes, always reach between your legs, not to the outside. You should try to follow these rules for about 8 weeks. When you move your hip and feel resistance, stop, that is as far as you should go.\n\nCan I sleep on my side?\n\nYes\n\nHow long will I be on pain medication?\n\nOnce the initial postoperative pain has subsided, we recommend Acetaminophen (Tylenol) to be taken instead of the narcotic you have been provided. It is also okay to take an anti-inflammatory medication (NSAID) such as Advil ONLY after finishing the blood thinners. Remember, you cannot drive while taking narcotic medications.\n\nWill I go to a rehabilitation facility or home?\n\nWe prefer our patients to go directly home after surgery. There may be special situations, which require a rehabilitation facility, depending on your social support structure.\n\nDo I need physical therapy?","Frequently Asked Questions after Total Hip Replacement Surgery\n\nWhat is the recovery time?\n\nEveryone heals from their surgery at a different pace.

There may be special situations, which require a rehabilitation facility, depending on your social support structure.\n\nDo I need physical therapy?\n\nYes! The physical therapist plays a very important role in your recovery. You will see a physical therapist soon after your operation and throughout your stay in the hospital. If you go home, you will likely have the therapist come to visit you (either as an evaluation or for more). Sometimes you will be referred to an outpatient physical therapist. If you go to a rehabilitation facility, you will receive therapy there. Your therapist will help you walk, regain motion, build strength, and help you reach your post-operative goals. Your therapist will keep your surgeon informed of your progress.\n\nWhat exercises should I do?\n\nYou will be instructed by your physical therapist on appropriate exercises and given a list to follow. In general, swimming (after 3 weeks) and a stationary bicycle are good exercise options. These exercises should be continued indefinitely even after your recovery is complete. You can begin using a stationary bike immediately; just make sure you keep the seat high.\n","Discharge to home, with or without home services, is associated with fewer adverse events compared to discharge to acute rehabilitation facility or skilled nursing facility.\n\n## Quality Of Evidence: Low\n\n## Rationale\n\nThere were no high quality and three low quality studies (Naylor 2017, McLawhorn 2017, Padgett 2018) evaluating whether discharge to an acute rehabilitation facility or skilled nursing facility improve outcomes and\/ or decrease complications compared with discharge to home, with or without home services. McLawhorn (2017) showed fewer adverse events and readmissions with home discharge. Padgett (2018) demonstrated a higher length of stay with home discharge, but no difference in adverse events. Naylor (2017) showed significantly better functional scores with home discharge. In the absence of reliable, comparative studies a consensus recommendation was made by the workgroup.\n\n## Benefits\/ Harms **Of Implementation**\n\nThere are no known harms associated with implementing this recommendation. The decision to discharge a patient to home versus post-acute care facility should be made with consideration of patient's medical complexity and postoperative function. The practitioner should be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of specific discharge disposition.\n\n## Future Research\n\nHigher-quality studies are needed to compare outcomes associated with discharge disposition following total knee arthroplasty.\n"],"28":["Celecoxib (Celebrex) 200 mg should be taken daily for the first 14 days after surgery.\n\nSenokot is the preferred stool softener and is to be taken routinely while on narcotic pain medications because of constipation.

However, they can still occur while taking blood thinners. Common signs include excessive leg or calf swelling and uncontrolled pain. Call the office if you are concerned regarding a blood clot.\n\nIf a blood clot travels to your lungs, it is called a pulmonary embolus which can cause a serious complication. Signs and symptoms include chest pain and\/or shortness of breath. If you develop these symptoms, please go to Emergency Room or call 911.\n","Total hip patients do not require as aggressive therapy and may start home physical therapy after discharge. During the 2-week post-operative appointment, hip patients can be transitioned into outpatient physical therapy.\n\nPhysical therapy is usually 3 times a week and you must continue to do the exercises on your own between therapy sessions. Do not rely solely on the presence of the therapist.\n\nWound Care and Surgical Dressing Management:\n\nFor all total joint patients, keep the surgical bandage in place until 7 days after surgery. Then remove the dressing and replace with a bandage provided by the hospital prior to discharge. Notify the office immediately if you notice an increase in drainage on the dressing (larger than quarter size).\n\nKeep your dressing dry. You may shower but wrap the bandage with plastic wrap when showering. No submerging the incision in water until 4-6 weeks. Do not apply creams, lotions, or ointments to the wound. Absorbable sutures are placed under the skin during surgery and do not require removal.\n\nMedications:\n\nYou will be discharged with multiple prescriptions to take at home:\n\nBlood thinners x 4 weeks (prevention of blood clots)\n\nAspirin is our primary medication of choice for standard risk patients. 81 mg twice daily for total knees and 325 mg twice daily for total hips.\n\nHigher risk patients such as patients with prior history of blood clots or pulmonary emboli will be treated with medications such as Eliquis 2.5 mg twice daily.\n\nPain Medications\n\nHydromorphone (Dilaudid) 2 mg and Tramadol (Ultram) 50 mg are the preferred medications for pain control. Please take only as needed as directed on prescriptions. Side effects of narcotic medications include but are not limited to: nausea, itching, somnolence, constipation, and fatigue. If you develop any adverse reactions, discontinue the medication and contact the office.\n\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) 650 mg should be taken every 6 hours for the first 7 days after surgery.

Make wide clear paths from your bedroom to your bathroom and kitchen, to accommodate the walker. Remove obstacles that may make you fall such as rugs, extension cords, or foot stools. Handrails in the stairs will make navigating stairs easier.\n\nSitting \u2013 A firm straight back chair with arm rests and a high seat will be best. A chair where knees are higher than your hips, is too low. You can add a foam cushion or pillow to elevate you if needed.\n\nSleeping \u2013 Ideally sleeping arrangements should be made so that you may sleep on the first floor of your home.\n\nFood \u2013 Arrange for assistance with meals. Freeze premade dinners ahead of time or have protein shakes available for quick access when needed. Good nutrition is needed to help you heal.\n\nTransportation \u2013 Prior to surgery, have transportation arranged for anticipated discharge date. Also, arrange transportation for post-op appointments (2 weeks and 6 weeks after surgery). DO NOT drive until cleared by surgeon, which is usually 2-4 weeks after surgery.\n\nTotal Joint Replacement Post-Op Care\n\nDischarge Disposition:\n\nHome is the primary discharge location after total joint replacement surgery. Patients are encouraged to go home with help from friends or family members.\n\nAlternative discharge locations such as skilled nursing facilities or rehabilitation facilities depend on multiple factors including social support, medical conditions, home set-up, insurance coverage, and safety.\n\nPhysical Therapy:\n\nPhysical therapy will be arranged while in the hospital by the case manager.\n\nTotal knee patients are encouraged to begin outpatient physical therapy after discharge. Outpatient facilities have more equipment to work with and facilitate faster recovery and knee range of motion.\n","Will I set off the machines at the airport? Do I need a doctor\u2019s note to travel?\n\nYou will likely set off the airport security machine. You do not require a doctor\u2019s note to show you have an artificial hip. Simply inform the security agent and you will likely require a separate screening.\n\nWhat activities are permitted after surgery?\n\nAfter 6 weeks, you are permitted to perform low stress activities such as walking, gardening, swimming and cycling. After 12 weeks, you are permitted to begin playing golf, racquet sports and gentle skiing.\n\nWhat activities should I avoid?\n\nYou should avoid impact activities such as running, aggressive skiing; heavy weight lifting, and other aggressive activities for the first 12 weeks. You should also avoid activities that involve heavy twisting movements like golf or bowling for the first 12 weeks. Then return, as you feel comfortable.\n\nCan I have sex?\n\nYou should wait several weeks after surgery before resuming sexual intercourse until you feel comfortable. Avoid extremes of motion. Having your legs apart is a safe position.\n\nCan I drink alcohol?\n\nWhile on blood thinners, you should avoid alcohol. You should also avoid alcohol while taking narcotics.\n\nShould I use ice or heat?\n\nIce should be used for the first several days to help with pain and swelling. We do not recommend using heat.\n\nCan I use stairs?\n\nYes. Initially you will lead with your non-operated leg when going up stairs and lead with you operated leg when going down stairs. Remember \u201cUp with the good, down with the bad.\u201d After about 4 weeks, you should begin using the stairs more normally.\n\nCan I kneel?\n\nYes. To kneel, touch down with the knee of your operated leg first. To arise from kneeling, use your non-operative leg first.\n\nI feel depressed \u2013 is this normal?\n\nIt is not uncommon to have feelings of depression after your hip replacement. This may be due to a variety of factors such as limited mobility, discomfort, increased dependency on others, and\/or medication side effects. Feelings of depression will typically fade as you begin to return to your regular activities. If your feelings of depression persist, consult your internist.\n\nI have insomnia \u2013 is this normal?\n\nDifficulty sleeping is a very common complaint following hip surgery. Non-prescription remedies such as Benadryl or melatonin may be effective. If this continues to be a problem, medication may be prescribed for you.\n\nWhat can I do about my scar?\n\nMost hip scars eventually become minor. If you feel hardness this may be to a suture dissolving underneath. After 3 weeks, and the wound is not draining, you can take some Vitamin E cream and begin some gentle massage to the wound. Avoid direct sun to the wound for 6 months to prevent darkening of the scar.\n","I feel depressed \u2013 is this normal?\n\nIt is not uncommon to have feelings of depression after your hip replacement.

In most cases, however, you will be restricted to using a walker or crutches for between 1 to 4 weeks. You will then be allowed to advance to a cane outdoors and no support around the house for several weeks. You will gradually return to normal function without any assistive devices. You will use an assistive device until you can walk without a limp. This usually takes about 3 months.\n\nWhat is a dislocation of the hip?\n\nA dislocation of the hip occurs when the femoral head (ball) comes out of the acetabulum (socket). While this risk is very small, typically less than 1%, we will ask you to avoid extremes of motion at the hip.\n\nWhat are the dislocation precautions for my hip (positions I should avoid)?\n\nThe goal of a hip replacement is to return your motion to the normal motion you had when your hip was healthy. In general, you should avoid positions that you have never been able to do. If you have to reach the floor, or fix your shoes, always reach between your legs, not to the outside. You should try to follow these rules for about 8 weeks. When you move your hip and feel resistance, stop, that is as far as you should go.\n\nCan I sleep on my side?\n\nYes\n\nHow long will I be on pain medication?\n\nOnce the initial postoperative pain has subsided, we recommend Acetaminophen (Tylenol) to be taken instead of the narcotic you have been provided. It is also okay to take an anti-inflammatory medication (NSAID) such as Advil ONLY after finishing the blood thinners. Remember, you cannot drive while taking narcotic medications.\n\nWill I go to a rehabilitation facility or home?\n\nWe prefer our patients to go directly home after surgery. There may be special situations, which require a rehabilitation facility, depending on your social support structure.\n\nDo I need physical therapy?\n\nYes! The physical therapist plays a very important role in your recovery. You will see a physical therapist soon after your operation and throughout your stay in the hospital. If you go home, you will likely have the therapist come to visit you (either as an evaluation or for more). Sometimes you will be referred to an outpatient physical therapist. If you go to a rehabilitation facility, you will receive therapy there. Your therapist will help you walk, regain motion, build strength, and help you reach your post-operative goals. Your therapist will keep your surgeon informed of your progress.\n\nWhat exercises should I do?\n\nYou will be instructed by your physical therapist on appropriate exercises and given a list to follow. In general, swimming (after 3 weeks) and a stationary bicycle are good exercise options. These exercises should be continued indefinitely even after your recovery is complete.
