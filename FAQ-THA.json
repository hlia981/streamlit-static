Remember that some redness and swelling is completely normal after a joint replacement and may gradually improve for up to three months. If you're concerned, call your surgeon for instructions.\n- Change in color, amount, odor of drainage\n- Increased pain in knee\n- Fever greater than 101\u00b0 F\n\n## Prevention Of Infection\n\n- Take proper care of your incision as explained.\n- Take prophylactic antibiotics when having dental work or other invasive procedures.\n- Notify your physician and dentist that you have a joint replacement.\n\n## Signs of Hip Dislocation after a Hip Replacement\n\n- Severe pain\n- Awkward rotation or shortening of your leg\n- Being unable to walk, bear weight, or move your leg in a normal fashion\n","## An Introduction To Joint Replacement\n\nPatients often have many questions about joint replacement. Below is a list of the most frequently asked questions along with their answers. If there are any other questions that you need answered, please contact your surgeon or the Joint Center Coordinator. We want you to be completely informed about your joint replacement surgery.\n\n## What Is Osteoarthritis And Why Does My Hip Or Knee Hurt?\n\nJoint cartilage is a tough, smooth tissue that covers the ends of bones where joints are located. It helps cushion the bones during movement, and because it is smooth and slippery, it allows for motion with minimal friction. Osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, is a wear-and-tear condition that destroys joint cartilage. Sometimes as the result of trauma, repetitive movement, or for no apparent reason, the cartilage wears down, exposing the bone ends. This can occur quickly over months or may take years to occur. Cartilage destruction can result in painful bone-on-bone contact, along with swelling and loss of motion. Osteoarthritis usually occurs later in life and may affect only one joint or many joints.\n\n## What Is A Knee Replacement?\n\nA knee replacement is really a bone and cartilage replacement with an artificial surface. The knee itself is not replaced, as is commonly thought, but rather an implant is inserted on the bone ends. This is done with a metal alloy on the femur and plastic spacer on the tibia and patella (kneecap). This creates a new, smooth cushion and a functioning joint that can reduce or eliminate pain.\n\n## What Is A Hip Replacement?\n\nA hip replacement is an operation that removes the arthritic ball of the upper femur (thighbone) as well as damaged bone and cartilage from the hip socket. The ball is replaced with a metal ball that is fixed solidly inside the femur. The socket is replaced with a plastic or metal liner that is usually fixed inside a metal shell to create a smoothly functioning joint.\n","## When Can I Have Sexual Intercourse?\n\nThis is a question that is asked quite often with any orthopedic surgery. The time to resume sexual intercourse should be discussed with your orthopedic physician and is nothing to be embarrassed about. If you're more comfortable, he or she may be able to provide you with written information that you can review later.\n\n## How Often Will I Need To Be Seen By My Doctor Following The Surgery?\n\nYou will be seen for your first postoperative office visit ten to fourteen days after you are discharged. The frequency of follow-up visits will depend on your progress. Many patients are seen at six weeks, twelve weeks, and then every one or two years.\n\n## Are There Any Permanent Restrictions Following This Surgery?\n\nYes, high-impact activities, such as running, tennis, and basketball are not recommended. Injury-prone sports such as downhill skiing are also restricted. Patients who've had a hip replacement will need to observe a set of prescribed precautions that help to minimize the risk for dislocation. These restrictions are typically in effect for three months after your surgery. Please be sure to observe your hip precautions until your surgeon tells you that you may discontinue them. You will receive your specific and customized set of hip precautions in writing as part of your discharge instructions.\n\n## What Physical\/Recreational Activities May I Participate In After My Recovery?\n\nYou are encouraged to participate in low-impact activities such as walking, dancing, golf, hiking, swimming, bowling, and gardening.\n\n## Should I Try To Lose Weight Before My Joint Replacement?"],"9":["## Driving After Surgery\n\nPatients ask when they can begin to drive again after having joint replacement surgery. In general, patients can drive 2-3 weeks after surgery when they are no longer taking any narcotic pain medications.\n\n## Preventing Blood Clots\n\nYou will be prescribed medication to prevent blood clots from developing. It is important to know the signs & symptoms of a blood clot:\n- Pain and tenderness in the calf of the leg\n- Swelling in the leg that does not go down with rest and elevation\n- Low grade fever\n\nRemember to wear your TED elastic stockings when you are walking or sitting and have someone take them off at night when you go to bed. If either of your legs becomes swollen, get into bed and elevate your legs on two or three pillows. If the swelling does not go down, call your nurse or doctor.\n\n## When To Call A Nurse Or Doctor\n\n- If you have chills or a fever greater than 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C)\n- If you develop pain at your incision site that gets worse\n- If you have redness, swelling, incision pain, drainage (such as blood), pus or a foul smell at the incision site\n- If you develop calf pain or tenderness in either leg, swelling, redness or a low grade fever\n\n## What To Do In An Emergency\n\n- If it is an emergency, go to the MGH Emergency Room or the closest ER. If it is a life-threatening situation, call 911\n- If you have chest pain and\/or shortness or breath, call 911\n\n## Walking After Total Knee Replacement\n\nAfter your TKR, continue using your walker or crutches until your surgeon tells you it is okay to stop using them. When turning with a walker or crutches, DO NOT PIVOT OR TURN on your operated leg. Always turn taking small, well-placed steps, and turn AWAY from your operated leg.\n\n## Continuous Passive Motion Device\n\nA *continuous passive motion (CPM)* device can be used following total knee replacement surgery to slowly and gently flex and extend the knee joint. Ask your surgeon if a CPM device is right for you following your joint replacement.\n","# Your Recovery\n\n## When To Call For Medical Help\n\nIt is important that you know what to watch for as you recover and who to call if needed. When in doubt, call the nurse navigator line.\n\nCall Your Navigator if any of the following occur: \n- Fever of 101\u00baF that doesn't get better after taking medicine\n- Pain that gets worse or that you can't control with prescribed pain medicine\n- Separation of the edges of the incision or unusual bleeding\n- Increased redness or drainage around the incision\n- Blood, pus, or a foul odor coming from the incision\n- Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms or legs\n- Persistent headache, blurred vision, dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting\n- Skin rash \n- No bowel movement within 7 days after surgery\n\nCall Your Primary Care Physician if you have: \n- Concerns about your regular medicines\n- Symptoms of a urinary tract infection (burning, frequency, urgency)\n- Trouble controlling your blood sugar (if you have diabetes)\n\nGo to the Emergency Room or Call 911 if you have: \n- Difficulty breathing \n- Shortness of breath \n- Chest pain \n- Signs of a blood clot \n- Black or bloody stool \n- Bloody vomit\n","## Blood Clots\n\nSurgery may cause the blood to slow and stick together in the veins of your legs, creating a blood clot. This is why you need blood thinners after surgery. If a clot occurs despite these measures you may need to be admitted to the hospital to receive intravenous blood thinners.\n\n## Signs Of Blood Clots In Legs\n\n- Swelling in thigh, calf, or ankle that does not go down with elevation and persists overnight\n- Pain, heat, and tenderness in calf, back of knee or groin area.\n\n## Prevention Of Blood Clots\n\n- Ankle pumps\n- Limited walking\n- Compression stockings\n- Blood thinners\n\n## Embolism\n\nAn unrecognized blood clot could break away from the vein and travel to the heart, brain, or lungs. This is called an embolism and is a medical emergency. You should immediately CALL 911 if you suspect you or your loved one has an embolism.\n\n## Signs Of An Embolism\n\n- Sudden chest pain\n- Difficult and\/or rapid breathing\n- Shortness of breath\n- Sweating\n- Confusion\n- Anxiety\n- Feelings of approaching doom\n- Stroke-like symptoms (weakness or numbness on one side, difficulty speaking or swallowing, etc.)\n"],"10":["## Three Month Follow-Up\n\nYou will see your surgeon for another follow-up visit about 3 months after surgery. We encourage you to resume normal activities both inside and outside the home. Helpful tips:\n- Be realistic and pace yourself and gradually resume activities.\n- Increase your walking distance and activities, but not all at once.\n- Keep a cane in the trunk of your car to aid with discomfort, or uneven or icy ground.\n- Enjoy the benefits of your total joint. \n- Continue to call with any questions or concerns. Our staff is always available to assist you.\n\n## Six Months And Future Follow-Up Visits\n\nYour next appointment is six months after surgery, then once a year unless told otherwise. These appointments give you a chance to discuss any concerns about your total joint replacement or other joints in which symptoms may develop.\n\n## Lifelong Fitness\n\nThe goal of your surgery is to give you a new joint that allows you to perform everyday activities without pain. However, this joint is not indestructible. Avoid sports or other activities that may put stress on the joint until discussed with your surgeon. Stay as active as you can after recovering from your surgery. Ask your surgeon or therapist about activities and exercises that are right for you. It may or may not be appropriate to return to the exercise routine that you used before surgery. An increase in body weight puts stress on the hip, so try to maintain a healthy weight.\n\n## Potential Complications Blood Clots","# The Importance Of Lifetime Follow-Up Visits\n\nOver the last several years, orthopedic surgeons have noticed that many people are not following up with their surgeons on a regular basis. The reason for this may be that they do not realize they are supposed to or they do not understand why it is important.\n\n## So, When Should You Follow Up With Your Surgeon?\n\nThese are some general rules:\n- Every year, unless instructed differently by your physician.\n- Anytime you have mild pain for more than a week.\n- Anytime you have moderate or severe pain.\n\nThere are two good reasons for routine follow-up visits with your orthopedic surgeon:\n1. If you have a cemented knee, the integrity of the cement needs to be evaluated periodically. With time and stress, cement can sometimes crack. You probably would be unaware of this happening as it usually occurs slowly over a period of time. Seeing a crack in cement does not necessarily mean you need another surgery, but it does mean things need to be followed more closely. \n\n2. The second reason for follow-up is that the plastic liner in your knee can experience wear. Small liner particles can combine with white blood cells and may get in the bone leading to osteolysis, and similar consequences as detailed in number one above. Replacing a worn liner early and grafting the bone can keep this from worsening.\n\nX-rays taken at your follow-up visits can detect these problems. New X-rays can be compared with previous films to assess for changes. Your surgeon is happy that most patients do so well that they do not think of them often. However, they enjoy seeing you and want to continue to provide you with the best care and advice. If you are unsure how long it has been or when your next visit should be scheduled, call your orthopedist. They will be delighted to hear from you.\n","7. Your surgeon's office staff may recommend HSS@HOME or outpatient physical therapy for your post-operative rehabilitation. Your post-operative physical therapy typically begins within one week following your surgery, but please be sure to follow your surgeon's recommendation. If you would like to set up a post-operative appointment for outpatient physical therapy at HSS, please call 212-606-1317 to schedule and find the best location for you.\n\nAll patients must call the Hospital's presurgical information line at 212.606.1630 and listen to a pre-recorded message within 48 hours of your scheduled surgery for general instructions and a review of the preHospital process.\n\n8. Please complete the **Health Care Proxy** form and bring it with you on the day of admission. This is a form authorizing another person, designated by you, to make decisions with your physician about your care, should this become necessary.\n\n9. A nurse from the Call Center will contact you 1 business day prior to your surgical date with more detailed instructions, usually between 1:30 pm and 7:00 pm. This preoperative phone call will provide instructions to prepare you for surgery, including:\n- Specific medication and diet instructions.\n- The time and place to arrive.\n\n11. Wash the surgical area (front, side and back) with antiseptic soap solution at the end of your last bath or shower before surgery. The solution should be rinsed and removed after application. **Do not shave** your legs the day before or the day of surgery. Specific instructions will be provided at the presurgical screening appointment, the preoperative education class and during the preoperative phone call.\n\n12. Please **DO NOT** bring the sleep apnea machine, but please bring in the settings for your device. HSS has necessary equipment (i.e. mask, tubing). Patients with sleep apnea are generally required to stay overnight in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) to be monitored and observed."],"11":["## Arthritis\n\nThe word \"arthritis\" means joint inflammation. Arthritis of the hip is a disease that wears away the cartilage of the hip joint. Without an adequate layer of cartilage, the femur and the acetabulum rub on each other, bone on bone. When this happens, the joint becomes pitted and rough. The result is pain, stiffness and instability. There are many different types of arthritis. One major type is osteoarthritis, which is sometimes called degenerative joint disease. It is most common in people over age 50, but can occur at any age, especially if the joint was damaged earlier in life. Large weight-bearing joints such as the hip and knee are the most common joints affected. People with osteoarthritis often develop bone spurs around the joint that can also limit motion.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease that can attack many parts of the body, including the joints. In rheumatoid arthritis, the joint fluid contains chemical substances that attack the joint surface and damage it. Swelling, pain and stiffness are usually present even when the joint is not used.\n\n## Hip Replacement\n\nThe purpose of hip replacement surgery is to remove the damaged and worn parts of the hip and replace them with artificial parts called prostheses that make the hip strong, stable and flexible again. The prosthesis has the same basic parts as your own hip. In most cases, the implant will consist of two pieces: **the femoral component,** a metal shaft with a ball that is inserted into the thigh bone; and the acetabular component, a metal and polyetheylene cup that is inserted into the pelvis.\n","## Arthritis\n\nThe word \"arthritis\" means joint inflammation.

Cabilan, Hines, & Munday (2016) conducted a systematic review evaluating the evidence on the effectiveness of prehab on functional status, healthcare utilization, quality of life, and pain compared to a usual care group (Level II). Based on their review, prehab does not improve functional outcomes. For self-reported functional status, utilizing the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) osteoarthritis index, there were no statistically significant improvements.

Patients with chronic pain often suffer from insomnia, exhaustion, and depression, all of which are indicators of preoperative stress, thus putting the patient at high risk for post-operative pain (Ayers, Franklin, Ploutz-Snyder, & Boisvert, 2005). The long-term use of opioid medication preoperatively also will increase the risk of a more painful and extended recovery time (Zywiel, Stroh, Lee, Bonutti, & Mont, 2011). \n\nA pain management plan before surgery is a key component to a positive patient experience post-surgery. Approaches to address pain management prior to surgery may include enhancing the preoperative education to include an outline of the surgical procedure and expected outcomes. Some patients may benefit from earlier surgical intervention and a more intensive analgesic (Lewis, Rice, McNair, & Kluger, 2014) (Level I). Overall, a multimodal approach, including non-pharmacologic approaches such as ice and distraction, is necessary. \n\nNAON Best Practice Guideline: Total Knee Replacement Page 13 of 39\n","Overall, in the literature, prehab did not show improvement in long-term patient outcomes. Cabilan, Hines, & Munday (2016) conducted a systematic review evaluating the evidence on the effectiveness of prehab on functional status, healthcare utilization, quality of life, and pain compared to a usual care group (Level II).

Your surgeon's office staff may recommend HSS@HOME or outpatient physical therapy for your post-operative rehabilitation. Your post-operative physical therapy typically begins within one week following your surgery, but please be sure to follow your surgeon's recommendation. If you would like to set up a post-operative appointment for outpatient physical therapy at HSS, please call 212-606-1317 to schedule and find the best location for you.\n\nAll patients must call the Hospital's presurgical information line at 212.606.1630 and listen to a pre-recorded message within 48 hours of your scheduled surgery for general instructions and a review of the preHospital process.\n\n8. Please complete the **Health Care Proxy** form and bring it with you on the day of admission. This is a form authorizing another person, designated by you, to make decisions with your physician about your care, should this become necessary.\n\n9. A nurse from the Call Center will contact you 1 business day prior to your surgical date with more detailed instructions, usually between 1:30 pm and 7:00 pm. This preoperative phone call will provide instructions to prepare you for surgery, including:\n- Specific medication and diet instructions.\n- The time and place to arrive.\n\n11. Wash the surgical area (front, side and back) with antiseptic soap solution at the end of your last bath or shower before surgery. The solution should be rinsed and removed after application. **Do not shave** your legs the day before or the day of surgery. Specific instructions will be provided at the presurgical screening appointment, the preoperative education class and during the preoperative phone call.\n\n12. Please **DO NOT** bring the sleep apnea machine, but please bring in the settings for your device. HSS has necessary equipment (i.e. mask, tubing). Patients with sleep apnea are generally required to stay overnight in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) to be monitored and observed.\n\n13. The use of nicotine products (i.e., cigarettes, cigars, gum or patches) has been shown to increase risk of complications following surgery. They can inhibit bone and wound healing by decreasing blood flow to the surgical site. They can also increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) a.k.a. blood clots. Please discuss smoking cessation with your HSS Internist. Please do not smoke or vape the day of surgery.\n\n14. On the day of your surgery, you and your designated contact will be instructed to check in to the Patient Access Services area (off the HSS lobby).\n"],"14":["## Recovery\/Rehabilitation Process\n\nPhysical therapy and occupational therapy after your joint replacement surgery are critical parts of your recovery, as well as to help you regain range of motion and strength. Although you may feel significant pain during and after your therapy sessions, it is necessary for your recovery. Your physical therapist will teach you how to:\n- Move from sitting to standing\n- Walk with an assistive device (a walker, crutches, a cane)\n- Comply with hip and knee precautions\n- Perform a home exercise program on your own\n- Walk up and down stairs with an appropriate assistive device\n\nYour occupational therapist will teach you how to:\n- Comply with hip or knee precautions while performing functional activities\n- Perform transfer techniques, such as getting on and off toilet seat with and without assistance or getting into and out of a car\n- Perform self-care activities, such as dressing with adaptive equipment and assistance if needed\n\n## Total Joint Precautions\n\nWhile recovering from surgery, you will follow specific precautions provided to you by your therapists. These precautions allow you to heal properly and help prevent potential complications. Make sure to ask your surgeon when it is safe to stop following these precautions.\n\n## Knee\n\n- Do not pivot or twist your operated leg\n- Do not kneel or squat\n\n## Hip\n\nNote: Precautions may vary, depending on the surgical approach. Your surgeon and therapist will discuss your specific precautions. General precautions are as follows:\n- Do not bend your operated leg beyond a 90 degree angle\n- Do not pivot or twist your operated leg\n- Do not cross your operated leg or ankle\n","VTE Prophylaxis Plan\n\nThe risk of developing blood clots in either a deep vein in the lower extremity (deep vein thrombosis or DVT) or the lung (pulmonary embolism or PE) after joint replacement is high. Following orthopedic surgery, the incidence can be 40% to 60% (Cohen et al., 2012). The risk for fatal PE is 0.2% to 0.3%. Deep vein thrombosis can cause pain, swelling, and erythema. Pulmonary emboli can present with shortness of breath, pain on inspiration, and tachycardia. If not treated, PE can result in circulatory collapse and death (Forster & Stewart, 2015). Risk factors associated with VTE include inactivity, dehydration, hospitalization, trauma, clotting disorders with previous clot, varicose veins with phlebitis, pregnancy, oral hormonal contraceptives, malignancy, obesity, smoking, and age (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE], 2010).\n\nVTE prophylaxis treatment ideally should be modified to match the risk level for the individual patient; at the current time, all patients undergoing total knee replacements are considered in the high-risk category. Currently, there is no validated tool to do this for total knee replacement patients.\n\nPatients on anticoagulation therapy before surgery should discontinue anticoagulation\/antiplatelet therapy before surgery. Average risk patients should receive pharmacological anticoagulation therapy and mechanical VTE prophylaxis therapy after surgery. Relevant anticoagulants include low molecular weight heparin, fondaparinux, apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, low-dose unfractionated heparin, adjusted dose warfarin, and aspirin.\n\nPharmacological VTE prophylaxis should start within the medication specific timeframe, usually within 24 hours of surgery; timeframes vary by drug and recommendations. Pharmacologic prophylaxis should be continued for at least 14 days; newer recommendations propose these medications may be useful for up to 35 days (Forster & Stewart, 2015). Mechanical VTE prophylaxis such as compression stockings or sequential compression devices should be implemented upon admission, prior to surgery, and continued until full mobility is returned after discharge from the inpatient setting (Yi, Hui, Jian, & Yixin, 2014). \n\nPatients should mobilize early and at frequent intervals (AAOS, 2014; AAOS, 2011b). Early mobilization and routine mobilization is critical to achieve personal outcomes and prevent many complications including VTE (AAOS, 2011b). There is moderate evidence supporting neuraxial anesthesia is preferred to general anesthesia to prevent VTE (Khatod, Inacio, Bini, & Paxton, 2012). Patients and their support person(s) should be educated about VTE prophylaxis (Mazaleski, 2011). Education topics for patients and family members should include risk factors for VTE, pharmacological VTE prophylaxis, mechanical VTE prophylaxis, signs and symptoms of VTE, and how to get help if VTE is suspected.\n","the surgeon or the physician assistant who will examine your knee's range of motion and strength. You will also discuss when it will be appropriate to make an appointment to begin outpatient physical therapy. Should you have any cause for concern prior to your first office visit you should call your surgeon's office for advice. Your next visit will be around 6 weeks after the operation. At this visit you may have an X-ray taken to make sure that the knee replacement components are aligned. \n\n## Weight Bearing\n\nAfter surgery you are allowed to put as much weight on your operated leg as you can tolerate (unless otherwise indicated by your surgeon). For the first several weeks after surgery you will require the use of a walker or crutches. As your tolerance for weight bearing improves your physical therapist will transition you to walking with a cane. Eventually, when your gait is normal you will be able to walk without an assistive device. Many patients are able to walk without an assistive device by six weeks after the operation. Remember, proper gait pattern *must* be achieved in order to discontinue use of assistive devices. \n\n## Recovery\/Time Off Work"],"15":["Stairs\n\nGoing up stairs: Use crutches or cane in 1 hand and, with the other hand, hold onto the railing.

The purpose of this best practice guideline is to provide the literature that supports these practices. The main goal of these programs is to improve patient outcomes and expedite recovery by optimizing the surgical care pathway prior to surgery. The outcomes related to these practices in a total knee replacement include shortened length of stay, improved patient experience, and enhanced clinical and functional outcomes overall. \n\nOne intervention is a thorough patient assessment including measures like weight, height and BMI, hemoglobin A1C, renal function, activity level and management of co-morbidities. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) shows strong evidence to support that obese total knee patients have less improvement in outcomes and moderate evidence to support that patients with diabetes are at higher risk for complications after a total knee replacement. \n\nThe documentation of a complete and thorough assessment can facilitate the healthcare team to effectively care for and educate the patient throughout the continuum.

The time to resume sexual intercourse should be discussed with your orthopedic physician and is nothing to be embarrassed about. If you're more comfortable, he or she may be able to provide you with written information that you can review later.\n\n## How Often Will I Need To Be Seen By My Doctor Following The Surgery?\n\nYou will be seen for your first postoperative office visit ten to fourteen days after you are discharged. The frequency of follow-up visits will depend on your progress. Many patients are seen at six weeks, twelve weeks, and then every one or two years.\n\n## Are There Any Permanent Restrictions Following This Surgery?\n\nYes, high-impact activities, such as running, tennis, and basketball are not recommended. Injury-prone sports such as downhill skiing are also restricted. Patients who've had a hip replacement will need to observe a set of prescribed precautions that help to minimize the risk for dislocation. These restrictions are typically in effect for three months after your surgery. Please be sure to observe your hip precautions until your surgeon tells you that you may discontinue them. You will receive your specific and customized set of hip precautions in writing as part of your discharge instructions.\n\n## What Physical\/Recreational Activities May I Participate In After My Recovery?\n\nYou are encouraged to participate in low-impact activities such as walking, dancing, golf, hiking, swimming, bowling, and gardening.\n\n## Should I Try To Lose Weight Before My Joint Replacement?\n\nThis is a common question and one that warrants discussion. Patients with a degenerated hip or knee often find physical activity painful. The accompanying immobility can lead to some weight gain over time. It is fine to try to lose some weight before your surgery, but your surgeon recommends achieving this by adjusting your diet and being as active as your degenerated joint will allow. Please don't seek stimulants, appetite suppressants, or weight loss supplements as a means of losing weight prior to surgery. Typically when you discontinue these medications after surgery you'll be gaining all of the weight back at the worst possible time. However, if you're already taking these medications as part of your daily regimen, you can continue taking them. Remember that adjusting your diet and being as active as you can comfortably tolerate are the best recommended options for weight loss.\n","## When Can I Have Sexual Intercourse?\n\nThis is a question that is asked quite often with any orthopedic surgery.

To prevent and reduce the incidence of clot formation, mechanical devices (foot or calf pumps) are used while you are in the Hospital to squeeze the leg muscles, thus maintaining blood flow in the veins. Also, a medication to minimize clot formation will be prescribed.\n\n## Leg Swelling\n\nFollowing TJR, most patients develop swelling in the operated leg. Although the amount of swelling can vary from patient to patient, the swelling itself, in the leg, knee, ankle or foot, is normal and may be accompanied by \"black and blue\" bruising that will usually resolve gradually over several weeks. For the first month after your operation, prolonged sitting with your foot in a down position tends to worsen the swelling. You should not sit for more than 30 to 45 minutes at a time. Periods of walking should be alternated with periods of elevating your leg in bed. When elevating the leg while lying down, the ankle should be above the level of the heart. \n\nTo prevent or reduce leg and ankle swelling:\n- Elevate operated leg in bed on one to two pillows while lying flat.\n- Avoid sitting for longer than 30 to 45 minutes at a time.\n- Perform ankle exercises.\n- Apply ice to your surgical area for 20 minutes a few times a day (before and after exercises).\n- Some doctors may recommend the use of support hose.\n"],"18":["## When Can I Have Sexual Intercourse?\n\nThis is a question that is asked quite often with any orthopedic surgery.

For more information, please read the Appendix \"The Importance of Lifetime Follow-up Visits.\"\n","# Overview Of Total Knee Replacement\n\nThe knee joint is the largest joint in the body. It is the \"hinge\" joint of the leg. It's the joint that allows the leg to bend and straighten. The knee joint is located at the meeting point of the thigh bone (*femur*) and the shin bone (*tibia*). The knee cap (patella) covers the area where the two bones meet. During total knee replacement surgery, the damaged part of your knee is removed and replaced with an implant. Implants are made of various materials: stainless steel, titanium, chrome, cobalt, or polyethylene. Bone cement may also be used in the repair. The choice of implants varies from person to person. Factors considered are your age, activity level, body type, and the amount and strength of your bone and bone tissue. Your surgeon will choose the implant that is best suited for your needs and lifestyle. During total knee replacement surgery, a relatively thin amount of bone is removed from the end of the thigh bone, the top of the leg bone, and the underside of the kneecap. This creates bone surfaces that allow the implant to have a good fit. Most of the major ligaments and tendons of the knee are left in place so that the knee can bend and straighten, yet remains steady in position from side-to-side and front-to-back.\n"],"20":["## Infection Prevention\n\nInfection is a possible complication of joint replacement surgery. Therefore, it is very important to take good care of yourself with preventive care, screenings, tests, and procedures. If you ever experience signs or symptoms of an infection such as fever, chills, pain, redness, and\/or drainage from the incision area, call your surgeon. \n\nAn infection could start from a sore throat, urinary tract infection, deep cut, or even an ear infection. Some tests, diagnostic procedures, and illnesses can place you at a greater risk for developing an infection in your new joint even years after surgery. That's because bacteria can be introduced into your bloodstream in any number of ways. Once in the bloodstream, the bacteria can travel to your new joint and cause an infection because the artificial joint does not have your body's natural protection against infection. \n\nThree of the most common healthcare situations you might encounter that can cause an infection are dental care, urological care, and colonoscopy.\n\n## Dental Care\n\nDental care after surgery can introduce bacteria into your bloodstream through cuts and trauma to the gums and gum lines. In anticipation of this risk, most surgeons recommend taking a one-time dose of antibiotics just prior to any dental work. Your surgeon will have specific instructions and the length of time they need to be followed after joint surgery. Also, make sure your dentist and dental hygienist are aware of your new joint.\n\n## Urological Care\n\nInvasive procedures involving the urethra, bladder, ureters, or kidneys are ways that bacteria can enter your system and contaminate your bloodstream. Make sure to inform any medical personnel about your artificial joint before they perform an invasive urological procedure. More important, talk to your orthopaedic surgeon before undergoing any urological procedure. Your surgeon will provide specific recommendations for you to follow.\n\n## Colonoscopy","## Skilled Nursing Facility Rehabilitation (Snf)\n\nIf you are not independently mobile and do not have assistance at home, you may need an inpatient rehabilitation setting. To qualify for inpatient rehab in a SNF, you need to meet criteria for admission and have insurance coverage. SNFs are primarily nursing homes that provide short-term rehabilitation in addition to long-term care. They provide skilled nursing, physical and occupational therapy.\n\nThe Preadmission Orthopaedic Nurse Case Manager will provide you with options of SNFs contracted with your insurance. You, along with your family and friends, are encouraged to tour facilities and inform the Preadmission Orthopaedic Nurse Case Manager of your selections before your surgery. Referrals per your request will be initiated by the Preadmission Orthopaedic Nurse Case Manager in an effort to secure bed availability. \n\n## Transportation\n\nThe Inpatient Nurse Case Manager, with your doctor and therapist, will assess the most appropriate transportation for you to travel home or to a facility. The Inpatient Nurse Case Manager will also identify insurance coverage. Most patients can travel home in a car. Discharge time is approximately 10:00 am, but speak with your inpatient care team for the most accurate timeframe for your discharge.\n\n## Acute Rehabilitation Hospital\n\nIf you are not independent with your mobility, do not have assistance at home and have complex medical issues, you may qualify for intense medical management and rehabilitation. The Preadmission Orthopaedic Nurse Case Manager can provide additional information if you feel that you may qualify for this level.\n\n## Mgh Outpatient Pharmacy","## Infection Prevention\n\nInfection is a possible complication of joint replacement surgery. Therefore, it is very important to take good care of yourself with preventive care, screenings, tests, and procedures. If you ever experience signs or symptoms of an infection such as fever, chills, pain, redness, and\/or drainage from the incision area, call your surgeon. \n\nAn infection could start from a sore throat, urinary tract infection, deep cut, or even an ear infection. Some tests, diagnostic procedures, and illnesses can place you at a greater risk for developing an infection in your new joint even years after surgery. That's because bacteria can be introduced into your bloodstream in any number of ways. Once in the bloodstream, the bacteria can travel to your new joint and cause an infection because the artificial joint does not have your body's natural protection against infection. \n\nThree of the most common healthcare situations you might encounter that can cause an infection are dental care, urological care, and colonoscopy.\n\n## Dental Care\n\nDental care after surgery can introduce bacteria into your bloodstream through cuts and trauma to the gums and gum lines. In anticipation of this risk, most surgeons recommend taking a one-time dose of antibiotics just prior to any dental work. Your surgeon will have specific instructions and the length of time they need to be followed after joint surgery. Also, make sure your dentist and dental hygienist are aware of your new joint.\n\n## Urological Care\n\nInvasive procedures involving the urethra, bladder, ureters, or kidneys are ways that bacteria can enter your system and contaminate your bloodstream. Make sure to inform any medical personnel about your artificial joint before they perform an invasive urological procedure. More important, talk to your orthopaedic surgeon before undergoing any urological procedure. Your surgeon will provide specific recommendations for you to follow.\n\n## Colonoscopy\n\nRoutine colonoscopy screenings are an important part of preventive care. However, a colonoscopy can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream and eventually your artificial joint. Speak with your surgeon and gastroenterologist about the precautions that need to be taken. Make sure you follow your physicians' recommendations to protect yourself and your new joint.\n"],"21":["## Driving After Surgery\n\nPatients ask when they can begin to drive again after having joint replacement surgery. In general, patients can drive 2-3 weeks after surgery when they are no longer taking any narcotic pain medications.\n\n## Preventing Blood Clots\n\nYou will be prescribed medication to prevent blood clots from developing. It is important to know the signs & symptoms of a blood clot:\n- Pain and tenderness in the calf of the leg\n- Swelling in the leg that does not go down with rest and elevation\n- Low grade fever\n\nRemember to wear your TED elastic stockings when you are walking or sitting and have someone take them off at night when you go to bed. If either of your legs becomes swollen, get into bed and elevate your legs on two or three pillows. If the swelling does not go down, call your nurse or doctor.\n\n## When To Call A Nurse Or Doctor\n\n- If you have chills or a fever greater than 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C)\n- If you develop pain at your incision site that gets worse\n- If you have redness, swelling, incision pain, drainage (such as blood), pus or a foul smell at the incision site\n- If you develop calf pain or tenderness in either leg, swelling, redness or a low grade fever\n\n## What To Do In An Emergency\n\n- If it is an emergency, go to the MGH Emergency Room or the closest ER. If it is a life-threatening situation, call 911\n- If you have chest pain and\/or shortness or breath, call 911\n\n## Walking After Total Knee Replacement\n\nAfter your TKR, continue using your walker or crutches until your surgeon tells you it is okay to stop using them. When turning with a walker or crutches, DO NOT PIVOT OR TURN on your operated leg. Always turn taking small, well-placed steps, and turn AWAY from your operated leg.\n\n## Continuous Passive Motion Device\n\nA *continuous passive motion (CPM)* device can be used following total knee replacement surgery to slowly and gently flex and extend the knee joint. Ask your surgeon if a CPM device is right for you following your joint replacement.\n","## Where Will I Go After Discharge From The Hospital?\n\nYou should plan to go home or to the home of a relative or friend directly after discharge. Insurance requirements determine eligibility for short-term rehab, and this decision is based on how well you're doing postoperatively. \n\n## Will I Need Help At Home?\n\nYes, for the first several days or weeks, depending on your progress, you will need someone to assist you with meal preparation, cleaning, etc. Family or friends need to be available to help if possible.\n\n## Will I Need Physical Therapy When I Go Home?\n\nYes, most patients will have in-home physical therapy ordered by their surgeon. \n\n## How Long Until I Can Drive And Get Back To Normal?\n\nThe ability to drive depends on whether surgery was on your right leg or your left leg and the type of car you have. If the surgery was on your left leg and you have an automatic transmission, you could be driving at two weeks. If the surgery was on your right leg, your driving could be restricted as long as six weeks.\n\n## When Will I Be Able To Get Back To Work?\n\nWe recommend that most people take at least one month off from work, unless their jobs are quite sedentary and they can return to work with a walker or crutches.\n","## Surgical Incision\/Dressing\n\nYou will have a dressing placed on your knee after surgery which will remain in place for 1 week. If you have staples closing your incision they will likely be scheduled to be removed around 10-14 days after the operation, and replaced with steri-strips. Allow the steri-strips to fall off on their own. If your surgeon used glue to close the wound do not remove it and it will gradually fall off approximately 1 month after surgery.\n\n## Showering\n\nYou may shower with the post-op dressing immediately. After the dressing is removed you may shower as long as the incision is not draining. If the incision is draining try to keep it from getting wet during showering by using a water-tight dressing. Do not submerge your dressing and\/or knee joint in a bath, hot tub, or pool until the incision is healed or you are cleared by your surgeon. \n\n## Medication\n\nYour surgeon will prescribe pain medicine for you after the operation. Your goal should be to switch from a narcotic medication to an over the counter pain medication as soon as you are able. \n\n## Driving\n\nYour surgeon will tell you when you are ready to return to driving. Commonly, you are not permitted to drive for 6 weeks if you had your right knee replaced, and 4 weeks if you had your left knee replaced. You cannot drive while taking narcotics.\n\n## Elevation\n\nElevating your lower extremity periodically throughout the day can help reduce swelling. It is recommended that you elevate your operative leg 3 to 5 times a day for 30 minutes. \n\n## Ice\n\nYou must use ice on your knee after the operation for management of pain and swelling. Ice should be used continuously for the first 48-72 hours. After that, you may taper down to applying ice 3-5 times a day for 10 to no more than 20 minutes at a time. \n\n## Post-Operative Office Visits\n\nYour first post-operative visit will be as early as 10 -14 days after the operation.\n"],"22":["support person(s) should be educated about the risks of using urinary catheters and the signs and symptoms of POUR as well as urinary tract infections.\n\n## Drain Removal\n\nAs noted above, drains are no longer best practice and should only be used in rare circumstances. Intraarticular drains are used to avoid internal fluid collection and may be continuous suction or intermittent. Limiting fluid collections in and around the wound could accelerate healing, promote tissue approximation, lower risk for infection, and decrease pain. The use of drains is also associated with increased blood loss, which may result in blood transfusion. A review of randomized controlled trials found that using drains had no clinical benefits to patient outcomes. If a drain is placed, the nurse is responsible for observing and recording output. There are some studies that suggest that drainage of more than 100ml per hour requires clamping of the drain and drainage of less than 70ml over eight hours requires the drain to be removed.\n\n## Constipation Prevention\n\nConstipation is a complication that can occur after a total knee replacement. This occurs due to a decrease in activity, decreased fluid intake, and medications such as opioids. Patient education is extremely important to educate and engage patients and families to prevent this complication. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) recommends that risk of constipation in post-surgical patients can be decreased with an increased intake of fluids and fiber, early mobilization, and a decrease in opioid medications. Nurses play an instrumental role in providing education at discharge to help patients prevent and manage constipation at home. Nurses should educate patients on nonpharmacological management of constipation and provide medication teaching on any prescribed laxatives.\n\n## Prevention Of Readmissions","support person(s) should be educated about the risks of using urinary catheters and the signs and symptoms of POUR as well as urinary tract infections.\n\n## Drain Removal\n\nAs noted above, drains are no longer best practice and should only be used in rare circumstances.

Nurses should educate patients on nonpharmacological management of constipation and provide medication teaching on any prescribed laxatives.\n\n## Prevention Of Readmissions\n\nPreventing readmissions following a total knee replacement has become an important priority related to quality and value within healthcare; healthcare outcomes have increasing financial implications. Studies have shown there is a cost burden to the healthcare system caused by readmissions. Performance and quality improvement strategies to improve patient outcomes are an important contributor for any program and organization seeking to decrease readmissions.\n\nPugely, Callaghan, Martin, Cram, & Gao utilized the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database to analyze risk factors, complications and 30-day readmission rates for nearly 12,000 total knee replacement patients. In this review, overall 30-day readmission rates were 4.6% for this population. The most common complications associated with readmission were surgical site infections (SSI), thromboembolic disorders, and systemic infections such as sepsis and pneumonia. Higher occurrence of readmissions was found in patients with advanced age, male gender and comorbidities such as COPD, CHF, and Diabetes.\n","## Bladder And Bowel Care\n\nSome people may find it hard to urinate after surgery because of the anesthesia, pain medications and decreased mobility. If necessary, your surgeon may request to insert a catheter to drain your urine. Constipation can become another problem several days after surgery. Drink a lot of fluids and eat foods that are high in fiber. We may give you a stool softener and laxatives to help with constipation.\n\n## Incision Care\n\nA dressing will cover your incision. Your wound must be kept clean, dry and covered. We will discuss wound care with you before discharge.\n\n## Respiratory Care\n\nSecretions tend to pool in the lungs and can lead to pneumonia. To prevent this, we will teach you to breathe deeply and cough, as well as how to use an incentive spirometer. This allows air to fill the tiny air sacs in the bases of your lungs. The deep breathing also helps to break up the mucus.\n\n## Circulation\n\nLack of activity causes the blood to circulate more slowly and pool in the legs. This can lead to the formation of blood clots. To reduce this risk, your surgeon will order sequential compression devices (SCDs) or foot cuffs for you to wear. Your surgeon may also prescribe blood thinners.\n"],"23":["## Preventing Infection (Antibiotic Prophylaxis)\n\nIt is very important that you protect your artificial joint from potential infection. Some patients have increased risk following total joint surgery, as an infection can spread to the new joint through the bloodstream from another source in your body. Please tell all of your health providers that you have an artificial joint as they may need to prescribe antibiotics before treatment. This is especially important before dental procedures and invasive urinary procedures. \n\nThe following is based on the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) guidelines and recommendations to help show when antibiotic treatment is indicated. Patients at potential increased risk of hematogenous total joint infection include:\n- Patients who are immunocompromised or immunosuppressed:\n  - Inflammatory joint arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus\n  - Disease, drug or radiation-induced immunosuppression\n\n## Other Patients:\n- Insulin-dependent (Type 1) diabetes \n- Within two years following joint replacement \n- Previous prosthetic joint infections \n- Malnourishment \n- Hemophilia\n\n## Dental Procedures\n\nThere is a higher incidence of infection with certain dental procedures:\n- Dental extractions \n- Periodontal procedures including surgery, subgingival placement of antibiotic fibers\/strip, scaling and root planning, probing, recall maintenance\n- Dental implant placement and reimplantation of avulsed teeth\n- Endodontic (root canal) instrumentation or surgery only beyond the apex \n- Initial placement of orthodontic bands\n- Intraligamentary local anesthetic injections \n- Prophylactic cleaning of teeth or implants where bleeding is anticipated.\n\nFor at least two years following surgery, please be sure to tell your internist and dentist that you have an artificial joint so that they can prescribe antibiotics prior to these procedures. If you have any questions or concerns, please call your surgeon's office.\n","# Preparing For Surgery\n\nJoint replacement is an elective surgery. Therefore, it is important that your state of health be evaluated thoroughly prior to undergoing the procedure.\n\n## Physician Visits And Lab Tests\n\nBefore surgery, most patients will complete an evaluation that may include a pre-operative physical exam, lab tests, EKG and X-rays. Your physician may discuss temporarily stopping the use of some medications, such as aspirin or other anti-inflammatory medications, about 1 week prior to surgery. \n\nThese medications tend to make your blood thinner and could cause more bleeding during your surgery. \n\n## Dental Care Before Surgery\n\nIf you are scheduled to have dental work within the 6 weeks prior to your joint replacement surgery, please tell your surgeon's office staff. Your surgeon may provide specific instructions or guidelines for you to follow. \n\n## Infection Prevention\n\nInfection is a rare complication of joint replacement surgery. If you have any signs or symptoms of infection prior to surgery, tell your physician immediately. Your surgery may need to be delayed until you receive appropriate treatment. While in the hospital, you will receive antibiotics before and after surgery to reduce your risk of infection.\n","# Preparing For Surgery\n\nJoint replacement is an elective surgery.

Applying ice to your affected joint will decrease discomfort. You can use it before and after your exercise program. Remember to always use a barrier between your skin and the ice.\n\n## Body Changes\n\n- Your appetite may be poor. Drink plenty of fluids to keep from getting dehydrated. Your desire for solid food will return.\n\n- You may have difficulty sleeping, which is normal. Do not sleep or nap too much during the day.\n\n- Your energy level will be decreased for at least the first month.\n\n- Pain medications that contain narcotics can promote constipation. Use stool softeners and laxatives, if necessary.\n\n## Blood Thinners\n\nYou will be given a blood thinner to help avoid blood clots in your legs. You will need to take it for two to six weeks depending on your individual situation. Be sure to take your blood thinner exactly as directed by your surgeon. If you have bleeding from any place where you would not normally find blood or if you experience multiple, unexplained bruises please contact your surgeon's office immediately for instructions. It is important that this be addressed in a timely fashion.\n","## The Days Following Surgery\n\nYour goal is to keep moving. We encourage you to get up for meals, go to the bathroom, and get out of bed - all with assistance. You will continue to have therapy, and your activity level will be increased. Pain is an expected part of recovery. Pain levels vary per person. We will give you cold packs or wraps to manage your pain and reduce swelling. Oral pain medication will be prescribed for you and available at discharge.\n\n## Medication\n\nAfter surgery, we will give you medication to thin your blood. This medication, also called an anti-coagulant, lessens the chance of harmful clots forming in your blood vessels. Blood-thinning drugs may be given by mouth or by injection.\n\n## Your Hospital Discharge\n\nDischarge planning starts the moment you decide to have surgery. One of the first things you need to do is arrange a ride for the day of your discharge. Most patients are ready to be discharged from the hospital one to three days after surgery; however, specific criteria must be met. You will be discharged from the hospital when: \n- Your medical condition is stable.\n- You are able to eat and urinate.\n- Your pain is controlled with oral pain medication.\n- Your home is prepared for your safety.\n- You successfully met physical and occupational therapy goals. If you have not met the criteria to be discharged home, you will be discharged to a skilled nursing facility.\n","# Preparing For Surgery\n\nJoint replacement is an elective surgery.

The time to resume sexual intercourse should be discussed with your orthopedic physician and is nothing to be embarrassed about. If you're more comfortable, he or she may be able to provide you with written information that you can review later.\n\n## How Often Will I Need To Be Seen By My Doctor Following The Surgery?\n\nYou will be seen for your first postoperative office visit ten to fourteen days after you are discharged. The frequency of follow-up visits will depend on your progress. Many patients are seen at six weeks, twelve weeks, and then every one or two years.\n\n## Are There Any Permanent Restrictions Following This Surgery?\n\nYes, high-impact activities, such as running, tennis, and basketball are not recommended. Injury-prone sports such as downhill skiing are also restricted. Patients who've had a hip replacement will need to observe a set of prescribed precautions that help to minimize the risk for dislocation. These restrictions are typically in effect for three months after your surgery. Please be sure to observe your hip precautions until your surgeon tells you that you may discontinue them. You will receive your specific and customized set of hip precautions in writing as part of your discharge instructions.\n\n## What Physical\/Recreational Activities May I Participate In After My Recovery?\n\nYou are encouraged to participate in low-impact activities such as walking, dancing, golf, hiking, swimming, bowling, and gardening.\n\n## Should I Try To Lose Weight Before My Joint Replacement?\n\nThis is a common question and one that warrants discussion. Patients with a degenerated hip or knee often find physical activity painful. The accompanying immobility can lead to some weight gain over time. It is fine to try to lose some weight before your surgery, but your surgeon recommends achieving this by adjusting your diet and being as active as your degenerated joint will allow. Please don't seek stimulants, appetite suppressants, or weight loss supplements as a means of losing weight prior to surgery. Typically when you discontinue these medications after surgery you'll be gaining all of the weight back at the worst possible time. However, if you're already taking these medications as part of your daily regimen, you can continue taking them. Remember that adjusting your diet and being as active as you can comfortably tolerate are the best recommended options for weight loss.\n","## When Can I Have Sexual Intercourse?\n\nThis is a question that is asked quite often with any orthopedic surgery.

When you bend or straighten your knee, the end of the femur rolls against the end of the tibia, and the patella glides in front of the femur. \n\nWith a healthy knee, smooth, weight-bearing surfaces allow for painless movement. Muscles and ligaments provide side-to-side stability. A membrane lines the joint. Cartilage acts as a cushion between the femur and tibia and is lubricated by synovial fluid. \n\nWith an arthritic knee, the cartilage cushion wears out. The bones rub together and become rough. The resulting inflammation and pain cause reduced motion and difficulty in walking. \n\nClinical and biomechanical research has steadily refined knee replacement methods and materials. Prosthesis durability can vary from patient to patient because each patient's body places slightly different stresses on the new knee. However, the average patient can expect to obtain greater mobility and freedom from pain, which will, in turn, improve ability to walk.\n"],"26":["## Do'S And Don'Ts For The Rest Of Your Life\n\nWhether you have reached all the recommended goals in three months or not, all joint patients need to have a regular exercise program to maintain their fitness and the health of the muscles around their joints. With both your orthopedic and primary care physicians' permission, you should be on a regular exercise program three to four times per week lasting 20\u201330 minutes. High-impact activities such as running and singles tennis may put too much load on the joint and are not recommended. High-risk activities such as downhill skiing are likewise discouraged because of the risk of fractures around the prosthesis and damage to the prosthesis itself. Infections are always a potential problem, and you may need antibiotics for prevention before dental work and invasive procedures for at least two years.\n\n## What To Do In General\n\n- Take antibiotics one hour before you have dental work or other invasive procedures.\n\n- Although the risks are very low for postoperative infections, it is important to realize that the risk remains. A prosthetic joint could possibly attract the bacteria from an infection located in another part of your body. If you should develop a fever of more than 101\u00b0 or sustain an injury such as a deep cut or puncture wound you should clean it as best you can, put a sterile dressing or an adhesive bandage on it and notify your doctor. The closer the injury is to your prosthesis, the greater the concern. Occasionally, antibiotics may be needed. Superficial scratches may be treated with topical antibiotic ointment. Notify your doctor if the area is painful or reddened.\n\n- Get an implant card from your surgeon that states you had a joint replacement. Carry the card with you, as you may set off security alarms at airports, malls, etc.\n\n- When traveling, stop and change positions hourly to prevent your joint from tightening.","## Do'S And Don'Ts For The Rest Of Your Life\n\nWhether you have reached all the recommended goals in three months or not, all joint patients need to have a regular exercise program to maintain their fitness and the health of the muscles around their joints.

There are specific criteria that need to be met for a patient to be a candidate for outpatient TKA. These criteria will be discussed with each patient pre-operatively, and it will be determined whether you may be an appropriate candidate. Typically outpatient TKA surgery would be scheduled early in the morning, and you would be discharged to home in the afternoon. You will have a Physical Therapy evaluation to confirm safety and independence in essential functional tasks, as well as to educate you about the home exercise program (HEP).\n\nIf it is determined that you will remain in the hospital after your TKA, you will typically spend 1-2 days in the hospital to recover. You will be out of bed the same day as your surgery. You will be working with physical and occupational therapy on a daily basis in the hospital. Most patients are able to go directly home after discharge. Some more complex cases may require a short stay in a rehab facility following their hospital stay. The determination to go to a rehab facility is based on medical necessity and safety at home.\n\n## Home Visits\n\nYou will likely receive home care visits from a registered nurse and a physical therapist after being discharged home. The nurse will help monitor your medical status and the physical therapist will help you work to restore mobility, strength and tolerance for activity. Your home care physical therapist will work with your surgeon and their staff to determine when you are ready to attend outpatient physical therapy.

McLawhorn (2017) showed fewer adverse events and readmissions with home discharge. Padgett (2018) demonstrated a higher length of stay with home discharge, but no difference in adverse events. Naylor (2017) showed significantly better functional scores with home discharge. In the absence of reliable, comparative studies a consensus recommendation was made by the workgroup.\n\n## Benefits\/ Harms **Of Implementation**\n\nThere are no known harms associated with implementing this recommendation. The decision to discharge a patient to home versus post-acute care facility should be made with consideration of patient's medical complexity and postoperative function. The practitioner should be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of specific discharge disposition.\n\n## Future Research\n\nHigher-quality studies are needed to compare outcomes associated with discharge disposition following total knee arthroplasty.\n","Typical Rehabilitation Continuum Time Frames Following TKA:\n\n## Inpatient Discharge Criteria\n\n1. Hemodynamically stable \n2. Mobilize either independently or with caregiver \n3. Pain managed with PO medications \n\nHome care discharge criteria: \n1. Patient to be independent and safe with self-care using DME and adaptive equipment. \n2. Patient to be independent and safe with mobility in the setting of their home using DME. \n3. Patient to be safe accessing the community with assistance of caregiver and DME.\n\n## Outpatient Discharge Criteria\n\nYou are ready for discharge from outpatient PT typically when you reach 70-80% functional level compared to before surgery. This can vary greatly based on your prior level of function. Some criteria may include:\n- Walking normally without any assistive device \n- Negotiate stairs reciprocally and safely \n- Getting in\/out of a car without difficulty \n- Donning\/doffing shoes and socks without difficulty\n\n**Being discharged from PT does NOT mean that you are exempt from your *home exercise program.* For optimal outcome after surgery, it is important to continue with your specific program designed by your PT.\n"],"28":["|                  | No driving until 4-6 weeks after surgery, to be determined by the surgeon                                                  |                                                                                                                          |\n|                  | Take Aspirin (or other prescribed DVT medication) for 2 full weeks after surgery                                            |                                                                                                                          |\n|                  | Take naproxen 500 mg twice daily for 30 days after surgery to prevent abnormal bone formation.                              |                                                                                                                          |\n|                  | Some pain or numbness in the groin, leg, and\/or foot can occur, but usually resolves within the first two weeks after surgery |                                                                                                                          |\n|                  | Ice hip 20-30 minutes, 5-6x a day using a thin barrier, do not use heat                                                    |                                                                                                                          |\n\n| Goals        |                                                                                                 | Protect repair                                              |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n|              | Increase range of motion                                                                        |                                                             |","## Pain Management\n\nDuring the first 4-6 weeks after surgery, patients often need to take narcotic pain medication. Most people are able to stop taking narcotics by four weeks post-operative. If you require narcotic pain medication beyond the normal post-operative course, you will be referred to the Pain Clinic or to your Primary Care Provider for further pain management. Acetaminophen (eg. Tylenol) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs: eg. Ibuprofen, Motrin, Aleve, Advil) are very effective for managing postoperative pain. NSAIDs are good at alleviating swelling and pain and are often more effective than narcotics. You should only take NSAIDs if they do not upset your stomach and it is okay with your doctor.\n\nRemember: Some narcotic pain medications cannot be called into a pharmacy. Plan ahead if your prescription is running low to allow for postal delivery.","## The Days Following Surgery\n\nYour goal is to keep moving. We encourage you to get up for meals, go to the bathroom, and get out of bed - all with assistance. You will continue to have therapy, and your activity level will be increased. Pain is an expected part of recovery. Pain levels vary per person. We will give you cold packs or wraps to manage your pain and reduce swelling. Oral pain medication will be prescribed for you and available at discharge.\n\n## Medication\n\nAfter surgery, we will give you medication to thin your blood. This medication, also called an anti-coagulant, lessens the chance of harmful clots forming in your blood vessels. Blood-thinning drugs may be given by mouth or by injection.\n\n## Your Hospital Discharge\n\nDischarge planning starts the moment you decide to have surgery. One of the first things you need to do is arrange a ride for the day of your discharge. Most patients are ready to be discharged from the hospital one to three days after surgery; however, specific criteria must be met. You will be discharged from the hospital when: \n- Your medical condition is stable.\n- You are able to eat and urinate.\n- Your pain is controlled with oral pain medication.\n- Your home is prepared for your safety.\n- You successfully met physical and occupational therapy goals. If you have not met the criteria to be discharged home, you will be discharged to a skilled nursing facility.\n"],"29":["## Post-Surgery\n\nYour orthopaedic care team will continue to closely monitor you after your surgery. They will check the color, movement and sensation in your legs. A nurse will create a personalized plan of care to meet your individual needs.\n\n# Your Hospital Stay\n\n## Inpatient Physical Therapy\n\nPhysical therapy is one of the most important parts of your recovery. We will plan for you to be out of bed within 6 hours after surgery. You will most likely begin physical therapy the day of your surgery. As an inpatient, you will receive physical therapy twice a day. Your surgeon and the rehabilitation services staff work together to develop an individualized therapy plan for you.\n\nDuring your therapy sessions, you will be instructed in exercises to help restore joint motion and strengthen the surrounding muscles. As you become stronger and progress toward your mobility goal, you will learn and practice how to: \n- Properly move and turn in bed \n- Get in and out of bed and chairs \n- Walk and climb stairs\u2014if appropriate to your home setting \n\nTherapy after your discharge will be based on your health status, abilities and the mobility level you achieved in the hospital. Your focus should be to work toward your optimal functional level with your home health therapist.\n\n## Bladder And Bowel Care\n\nSome people may find it difficult to urinate after surgery because of the anesthesia, pain medications and decreased mobility. If necessary, your surgeon may request a catheter be inserted to drain your urine. Constipation can become another problem several days after surgery. Drink a lot of fluids and eat foods that are high in fiber.

It is a dedicated center for orthopedic excellence within the Baptist Health System. With modern advancements in orthopedic surgery, the majority of patients are able to return home after a single night in the hospital. A joint replacement is considered to be an elective surgery and it's expected that you will be discharged directly to your home or the home of a relative or friend after you leave the hospital. Unfortunately, insurance requirements determine eligibility for short-term rehab and this decision is based on how well you're doing postoperatively. It is for these reasons that we cannot guarantee placement into a short-term rehab facility after your surgery. Of course you won't be discharged until it's deemed safe, but you should plan on going home after surgery and make preparations to have someone available to help you for at least a few days.\n\n## Features Of The **Program Include:**\n\n- Nurses, therapists and patient-care technicians who specialize in the care of joint replacement patients\n- Private rooms - Emphasis on group activities as well as individual care\n- Family and friends participate as \"coaches\" in the recovery process\n- Group discharge teaching session with you and your coach\n- A Joint Center Coordinator who coordinates your care while you're in the hospital and collaborates with a Social Worker for discharge planning \n- A comprehensive patient guidebook\n"],"30":["## Total Hip Arthroplasty\/Hemiarthroplasty Protocol:\n\nThe intent of this protocol is to provide the clinician with a guideline of the post-operative rehabilitation course of a patient that has undergone a total hip arthroplasty. It is no means intended to be a substitute for one's clinical decision making regarding the progression of a patient's post-operative course based on their physical exam\/findings, individual progress, and\/or the presence of post-operative complications. If a clinician requires assistance in the progression of a post-operative patient, they should consult with the referring surgeon. This protocol applies to the standard total hip arthroplasty\/hemiarthroplasty and hip resurfacing. \n\n## Progress To The Next Phase Based On Clinical Criteria And\/Or Time Frames As Appropriate. Dislocation Precautions:\n\nDislocation precautions are based on surgical approach and the direction in which the hip is dislocated intra-operatively (if at all) to gain exposure to the joint. Precautions include:\n\n## O Posterior Precautions:\n\no No hip flexion >90 degrees  \no No hip internal rotation or adduction beyond neutral  \no None of the above motions combined  \n\n## Anterior Precautions:\no No hip extension or hip external rotation beyond neutral  \no No bridging, no prone lying, and none of the above motions combined  \no When the patient is supine, keep the hip flexed at or above 30 degrees  \n- Pillow under the patient's knee or raise the head of the bed  \n\n## Direct Anterior Precautions:\no No full bridging  \n\n## Lateral Precautions:\no Hip abduction restrictions  \n\n## Limited Precautions:\no Either posterior or direct anterior approach  \no Avoid any extremes of movement or uncomfortable positions  \n\n## Global Precautions: \no Combination of both anterior and posterior precautions, described above  \no Often ordered for patients following hip resurfacing, due to full exposure of the femoral head and opening of joint capsule during surgery. Also often ordered after revision surgery due to a history of dislocations.  \n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services.

At this visit you may have an X-ray taken to make sure that the knee replacement components are aligned. \n\n## Weight Bearing\n\nAfter surgery you are allowed to put as much weight on your operated leg as you can tolerate (unless otherwise indicated by your surgeon). For the first several weeks after surgery you will require the use of a walker or crutches. As your tolerance for weight bearing improves your physical therapist will transition you to walking with a cane. Eventually, when your gait is normal you will be able to walk without an assistive device. Many patients are able to walk without an assistive device by six weeks after the operation. Remember, proper gait pattern *must* be achieved in order to discontinue use of assistive devices. \n\n## Recovery\/Time Off Work\n\nRecovering from Total Knee Arthroplasty surgery is not easy. It is very important that to realize that the recovery process is difficult and time-consuming. You must be an active participant during this process, performing daily exercises to ensure there is proper return of range of motion and strength. There is a large amount of variability in the time it takes to fully recover from this procedure. It is usually estimated that it will take at least 4-6 months for the patient to feel as though he or she has completely returned to a pre-injury level of activity. Some cases may take as long as 9-12 months to make a full recovery. People with desk jobs should plan to take at least 4 weeks off from work and should have an extended absence plan in place should complications arise. People with more physical jobs that require excessive weight bearing and manual labor will likely be out of work for at least 3-6 months. **Recovery is different in each case**.

It is also okay to take an anti-inflammatory medication (NSAID) such as Advil ONLY after finishing the blood thinners. Remember you cannot drive while taking narcotic medications.","29":"Yes.","30":"The goal of a hip replacement is to return your motion to the normal motion you had when your hip was healthy. In general you should avoid positions that you have never been able to do. If you have to reach the floor or fix your shoes always reach between your legs not to the outside. You should try to follow these rules for about 8 weeks. When you move your hip and feel resistance stop that is as far as you should go.","31":"A dislocation of the hip occurs when the femoral head (ball) comes out of the acetabulum (socket). While this risk is very small typically less than 1% we will ask you to avoid extremes of motion at the hip.","32":"Everyone heals from their surgery at a different pace. In most cases however you will be restricted to using a walker or crutches for between 1 to 4 weeks. You will then be allowed to advance to a cane outdoors and no support around the house for several weeks. You will gradually return to normal function without any assistive devices. You will use an assistive device until you can walk without a limp. This usually takes about 3 months."},"faithfulness":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":1.0,"8":0.7777777778,"9":1.0,"10":1.0,"11":0.3333333333,"12":0.6666666667,"13":0.7142857143,"14":1.0,"15":0.9230769231,"16":0.4444444444,"17":0.6923076923,"18":1.0,"19":0.7142857143,"20":0.4,"21":1.0,"22":0.9090909091,"23":1.0,"24":1.0,"25":0.125,"26":0.6666666667,"27":0.7272727273,"28":1.0,"29":0.6,"30":0.9230769231,"31":0.4285714286,"32":0.875},"answer_relevancy":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.6212788211,"8":0.8248376789,"9":0.6619161963,"10":0.9614212225,"11":0.8444555614,"12":0.6516161739,"13":0.4114010337,"14":0.3381366923,"15":0.6251501767,"16":0.0,"17":0.7363958545,"18":0.8950772798,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.7295267662,"22":0.5543780115,"23":0.3614615682,"24":0.8509404232,"25":0.0,"26":0.5223081879,"27":0.6112242082,"28":0.7365371087,"29":0.2573712189,"30":0.8456605633,"31":0.8502321466,"32":0.0},"context_recall":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.2857142857,"8":0.1428571429,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.3333333333,"12":0.25,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.3333333333,"16":0.0,"17":0.6666666667,"18":1.0,"19":0.3333333333,"20":0.3333333333,"21":0.2,"22":0.5,"23":0.0,"24":0.6666666667,"25":0.0,"26":0.25,"27":1.0,"28":1.0,"29":0.6666666667,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.3333333333},"context_precision":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":1.0,"8":0.5,"9":0.0,"10":1.0,"11":1.0,"12":1.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.5833333333,"15":1.0,"16":0.5833333333,"17":1.0,"18":0.9999999999,"19":1.0,"20":0.0,"21":1.0,"22":1.0,"23":1.0,"24":0.8333333333,"25":1.0,"26":1.0,"27":1.0,"28":1.0,"29":0.5,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.8333333333},"answer_similarity":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.5603813594,"8":0.6832028405,"9":0.3827664307,"10":0.6411293895,"11":0.6883577385,"12":0.5395366098,"13":0.5980485003,"14":0.6556977029,"15":0.7469795251,"16":0.4810930855,"17":0.7137084118,"18":0.6782888688,"19":0.6929478777,"20":0.617403712,"21":0.788899261,"22":0.6153953402,"23":0.5740893574,"24":0.7453434134,"25":0.686547837,"26":0.6022359142,"27":0.6711997407,"28":0.7038236035,"29":0.0570127391,"30":0.6727906085,"31":0.7388401566,"32":0.6200099221},"trace_id":{"0":"a41ac660-045b-49b2-a3b6-7717540ffd7c","1":"fc18f18d-1aab-49b0-96c1-4dab1f309613","2":"147d4ec9-dc7b-413f-9f9c-5e8ab14a57eb","3":"dc31d28a-7e00-4801-83a8-96123d1bdae5","4":"0fd6c735-8df2-4d69-91ed-8c0bec82764a","5":"1200640b-df4a-4e03-800d-b3af7186d002","6":"b37edca8-0907-40dc-9b48-059a0b03c486","7":"cd01d70a-798c-4222-a67c-f9ae0159d3d1","8":"e567428c-0699-4b00-8603-c42252ce742d","9":"73d99e39-cc3a-4c23-946d-d4579cff6c9d","10":"be7d731e-9796-47d3-8392-182fe9cc922e","11":"a7d7e0b9-a05a-4984-a8fb-0adc99343fef","12":"3f70891a-da33-43a6-9226-f3c7e5c8306f","13":"e840bb74-ca9e-4106-8049-7990d0b6de2b","14":"0675fe58-71a8-4807-a55d-3ec17cb38c86","15":"60093ae3-b5d0-4560-a774-13c23977768a","16":"921558ac-e663-4275-ac91-7e92ff16d5c2","17":"6c849d40-b76a-4dc6-b68f-61fe0c171c0b","18":"8b5ce130-d60e-458c-8d05-dd316d121a1e","19":"9054015a-adcb-4371-9a36-5bdda26f18cb","20":"b540c9e3-124e-4e04-a0aa-9703fd97b0ff","21":"927bf778-f1cc-4856-b46b-5243fae0629d","22":"424cdfd3-7ff4-4171-9675-4c5ccc1b6fde","23":"5b932b65-ca97-44f8-9df4-e9bef65712a8","24":"b71fcdda-0fd5-4bfe-963a-6baaf7e5f13e","25":"56209e81-0c45-47bc-ba90-248d22664952","26":"50e93ee3-8901-4e4b-890c-8708a4730204","27":"6746ee8c-d975-4b3e-82c8-e7a18a871d2a","28":"f027e8c9-badb-4d29-9822-4a8120c2012a","29":"8b5cabef-0e08-41ab-9d16-bab5bb32f2d3","30":"8ca80b24-c84a-4398-abc0-6409a94b280c","31":"076fff83-b93e-4659-95f3-3278cd79d9e1","32":"1c192523-a0e9-4adf-b944-ea9382517174"}}
